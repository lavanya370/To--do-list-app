🧾 What the App Does:

This is a simple text-based application that lets you:

View tasks

Add tasks

Remove tasks

Exit the program


It runs in the console using Python’s basic features like lists, functions, loops, and user input.

🔍 Let's go through the code step by step:

1. 📝 todo_list = [] This is an empty Python list where we’ll store the user’s tasks. Each time you add a task, it gets added to this list.


2. 🧭 show_menu() This function prints the main menu with 4 options. It helps the user know what they can do.


3. 👀 show_tasks() This function checks if there are any tasks in the list.

If there are none, it prints: “No tasks in your to-do list.”

If there are tasks, it prints them one by one with numbers so the user can see and choose which to remove.



4. ➕ add_task()

It asks the user to type a task.

Then, it adds that task to the list using append().

It confirms to the user that the task was added.



5. ➖ remove_task()

It shows the list of tasks.

Then it asks for a number (1 for the first task, 2 for the second, etc.).

It removes the task using pop(task_no - 1), because list indexes in Python start at 0.

If the user gives an invalid number (like text or a number that doesn’t exist), the try-except block catches the error and prints a helpful message.



6. 🔁 while True:

This is an infinite loop that keeps showing the menu until the user chooses to exit (option 4).

It gets the user’s choice as a string.

Based on the choice, it calls the correct function.



7. ❌ Exit:

If the user enters ‘4’, it prints a goodbye message and breaks the loop using break.




✅ Why this is a good beginner project:

It teaches how to use lists to store data.

It shows how to use functions for organizing code.

It uses if-else and loops for user choices.

It includes error handling with try-except.
